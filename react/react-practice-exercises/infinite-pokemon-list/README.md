# Infinite Pokemon List

This is a small app based on this
[React challenge](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-an-infinite-scrolling-list-of-pokemons/),
meant for practicing front-end development.

The project was generating using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development environment, with the `react-ts`
template.
